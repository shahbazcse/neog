            William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet, actor, inventor of words, master of drama, and arguably the most famous writer of all time.
            The language in which Shakespeare wrote is referred to as Early Modern English, a period that lasted from approximately 1500 to 1750. The language spoken during this period is often referred to as Shakespearian English.
